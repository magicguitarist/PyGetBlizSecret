PyGetBlizSecret
===============

Hacked together python to get your secret from blizzard. For use with authenticators


Usage
===

python getkey.py <serial> <restore code>

Restore code should be typed exactly as in your app. This does not store any information, just gives you the key for use with 3rd party authenticators. For my use, with the pebble watch.
